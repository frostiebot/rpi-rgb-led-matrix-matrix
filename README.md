# rpi-rgb-led-matrix-matrix
Python wrapper around the original rpi-rgb-led-matrix library to make things a little more pythonic

Main Library
------------

The bulk of the code is simply python code wrapping the pre-existing wrapper code of rpi-rgb-led-matrix.

See the various .py files at the root of this repo for examples on how to use, but honestly it's not much different than other existing examples.

Good luck!
